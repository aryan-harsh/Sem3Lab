## Problem Statement
1. The institute provides TAs for all students to ‘take care’ of the students. Every student gets a
TA. As per a new policy of the institute there is 1 TA for every k students. Assign TAs to students
roll number wise. The first TA as per input gets the first k students, the 2nd TA gets the next k
students and so on. The last TA gets all the left over students that may be less than, equal to or
greater than k. Please make sure that every TA and student should only be stored once in the
memory, and not be copied along with every student.

2.  In the above question also print the students associated with every TA separately. Please
make sure that every TA and student should only be stored only once in the memory, and
not be copied along with every student.

3.  A student attempts numerous assignments and gets marks for the different assignments. In
question 2, the student details are followed by the assignment details. Print the total marks
obtained by each student in addition. The first input is the number of test cases, with each test
case followed by the number of students and details of all students. Thereafter the next input is
the number of assignments a. For each assignment, the first input is the number of students who
attempted the assignment, followed by the roll number and marks scored by each student in the
assignment. If there are no marks associated with a student for an assignment, the student is
considered absent and marked as 0.
