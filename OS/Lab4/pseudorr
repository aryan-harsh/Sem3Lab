//THIS IS A PSEUDOCODE FOR ROUND ROBIN SCHEDULING

create a variable time_slice
initialise time slice as 3, as given in the question
create a structure which contains all details of a process such as name,arrival time, exittime ...
use file handling to open the file required
loop till end of file 
			read the data using struct
			store the data in the array of struct created
			increment variable no_of_processes

make variables for current time,an array for waiting time(wt[]) and turnaroundtime(tat[])










Avg_wt = total_wt / no_of_processes          
//print this in file
Average tat = total_tat / no_of_processes    
//print this in file
                 


//REPEAT ABOVE ALGORITHM FOR VARYING TIME SLICE FROM 1 TO 10
//USE A LOOP TO DO SO AND INITIALISE TIME SLICE AS i
//PRINT ONLY THE AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIME FOR EACH

//REPEAT ABOVE ALGORITHM FOR VARYING TIME SLICE FROM 1 TO 10
//USE A LOOP TO DO SO AND INITIALISE TIME SLICE AS i
//PRINT ONLY THE WAITING TIME FOR EACH
