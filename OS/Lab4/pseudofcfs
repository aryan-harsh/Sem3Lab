create a structure which contains all details of a process such as name,arrival time, exittime ...
use file handling to open the file required
loop till end of file 
			read the data using struct
			store the data in the array of struct created
			increment variable no_of_processes

make variables for current time,an array for waiting time(wt[]) and turnaroundtime(tat[])

loop for no_of_processes://(for i=0;i< no_of_processes;i++)			  		  		
      		calculate wt[i] = (bt[0] + bt[1] +...... bt[i-1]) - at[i] 
			calculate tat[i] =wt[i] + bt[i]  
          
loop for no_of_processes://(for i=0;i< no_of_processes;i++)		
			total_wt + = wt[i];				 
			//print this in file
			total tat + = tat[i];			 
			//print this in file

Avg_wt = total_wt / no_of_processes          
//print this in file
Average tat = total_tat / no_of_processes    
//print this in file
